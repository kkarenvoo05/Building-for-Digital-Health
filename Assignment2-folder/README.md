This folder contains the code for my Assignment 2 where I maintained a patient list view page, new patient form page, and patient detail view page.
I also created the struct "Medication" and "Dosage", which contains all the information required respectively. The class "Patient" was also used to store
information regarding each patient. For the patient list view page, I utilized the file 'PatientList' to order the inputted patients and the file 
'PatientView' displayed all the patients, including search bar. For the new patient form page, the file "NewPatientView" collected the information of the
new patient and saved that information to display on the patient list view page. Once the patient is created, the user can click onto the patient detail 
page, which is displayed using the "PatientDetailsView". This page displays all the inputted information and also contains a button that allows the user
to prescribe medication to the respective patient. The struct "PrescribeMedicationView" is used to input the information regarding the patient's new medication.
